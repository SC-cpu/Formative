  <p>Nowadays, wearable devices have been integrated into our lives. It can detect heart rate, blood pressure and other values in real time, and display the data intuitively in front of us through software, so that we can have more direct control of our own physical condition.</p>
  <br>
  <p>AI doctor has also appeared. He will help you to judge your condition according to thousands of medical records and professional knowledge. The breadth of his knowledge may be unmatched by any doctor. After all, he does not need too much time to learn.</p>
  <p>If you don't want to see AI doctor, you can also make an appointment on the Internet to save the waiting time and make the arrangement more flexible.</p>

  <p>One of the reasons for the decline in green on earth is the overuse of paper. The emergence of computers makes "paperless learning" and "paperless office" possible.</p>
  <p>Campus paper can not be ignored, especially in countries like China. The textbooks and test papers used by students every year are a huge number. If computer-aided learning is used, it will not only no longer need so much paper, but also the teaching materials will hardly be lost (just send another one if you lose it). Because of covid19, we have experienced online teaching in advance. Although this is temporary, it may become normal in the near future.</p>
  <p>It's the same thing in office. You don't need to print so many copies of documents. You just need to send them to everyone.</p>
  <br>
  <p>On the other hand, computers play an important role in climate change and natural disasters. Its powerful computing power makes it possible to predict the future. People are able to deal with possible disasters in advance, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes and so on.</p>

  <h2 id="c">Promote Communication</h2>

  <p>With a mobile phone and a computer, people thousands of miles away can meet. No matter where you are, at home, on the mountain or under the sea (as long as there is a network), you can communicate with people all over the world, and the existence of translation software makes language no longer an obstacle to communication. And even if you have to go out, self driving cars can do it for you. In addition to language, other information such as files, pictures and videos has been transmitted faster than ever before. At home, we can read books and see the scenery from all over the world.</p>
  <p>With the development of VR, AR and other technologies, what we can see is not the people and scenery in the small screen, but the people standing in front of us and the immersive experience.</p>
